#structural evaluation#

This package evaluates the damage status of structural components based on engineering demand parameters (EDPs) such as component rotation and strain. It also assesses the damage status of non-structural components according to storey acceleration, storey velocity, and storey drift ratio. These EDPs can be derived from FE analysis.
